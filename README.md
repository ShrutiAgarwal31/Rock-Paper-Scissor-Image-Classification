# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Image-Classification

Here I have used CNN to classify the images of rock, paper, sccisor using tensorflow and keras libraries.
I have implemented the model in three ways:
Basic Approach, 
Convultional Approach(using conv2d layers) and 
Better Convolutional Approach(by applying average pooling, max pooling, and dropout techniques)

#Results
Achieved accuracy of 80%
